I&#8217;ve given bicycle touring a try. Originally I wanted to bike around Lake Michigan, but it turns out to be over [1,400 miles][1]. So I compromised on a three day trip around a good chunk and making use of the ferry from Muskeegon, MI to Milwaukee, WI. This was my first time &#8211; so I also decided to stay in hotels. Next time I intend to camp. I learned a few valuable lessons along the way!

  * **Pack less stuff!** &#8211; I had way too much. In fact, I wound up breaking two spokes on the second day.
  * **Shorten the days** &#8211; Having never gone more than 40 miles in a single day, I decided to go 108 on the first day. Yeah. I probably should have gone more like 60-70 each day. By the time I got to my destination each day I was too tired to do anything. Part of the experience is seeing new places.
  * **Get a proper touring bike** &#8211; I didn&#8217;t use a touring bike because I don&#8217;t have one (yet). I used a [Trek 7.2][2]. My wrists hurt a lot for parts of the trip. Next time I&#8217;ll get a proper touring bike with the appropriate handle bars.
