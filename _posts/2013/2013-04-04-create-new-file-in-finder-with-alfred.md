I have created a simple workflow for Alfred 2 which makes it easy to create a new text file in the frontmost finder window. **Update** &#8211; at the suggestion of a visitor &#8211; [James Kachan][1] &#8211; I have updated the workflow to automatically open the new file in a text editor. [An alternative][2], more advanced workflow for Alfred 2 has also been created by Ian Isted.

#### Usage

Open Alfred 2, and type **new** followed by the name of the file. If you just type new, a file called &#8216;untitled.txt&#8217; will be created.
