# A big list of favorites

Here it is! My favorite things in life across all domains. This is a work in progress, but hopefully you'll find one (or a few) things you like and add it to your life. It's a bit sparse currently, but it will fill in over time. 

__Note:__ There are no referral links here and I am not being paid to advertise anything here. Any companies/products listed have earned it.


## Programming/Software

----

### Terminal

* __[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)__ - A phenomenal package manage. Use with [homebrew/science](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science)!
* __[Autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump)__ - Jump among directories by typing their `j` and their name. Even works if you type it incorrectly! Install with `brew install autojump`.
* __[pyenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv)__ - An easy way to manage multiple installations of python, and set which versions to open globally, locally, or by directory. Install with `brew install pyenv`. 

### Software (OSX)

* __[Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com)__ - The best backup/syncing solution. I pay for a subscription. I've used Box and Google Drive as well. Both are inferior.
* __[Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/)__ - FTP Client.

#### Utilities

* __[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)__ - The best text editor. Extend its functionality with [package control](https://packagecontrol.io/).
* __[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)__ - Like spotlight but with a lot more functionality. Workflows extend its functionality considerably. See the ones I've written!

__Databases__ 

* __[Sequal Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com/)__ - A MYSQL GUI. The best GUI for a database I've seen. 


### Web Development

* __Jekyll__ - Static sites
* __Flask__ - Python framework
* __[peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/)__ - A very easy to use ORM for simple projects.

### Programming
