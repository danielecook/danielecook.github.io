Today I am introducing a new slack team for bioinformatians in Chicago. 

<a class="btn btn-primary btn-large" href='https://chicagobioinformatics.slack.com/signup' >Signup for the Chicago Bioinformatics Slack Channel!</a>

Currently anyone with an email at the following domains can signup:

* @northwestern.edu
* @uchicago.edu
* @uic.edu
* @depaul.edu
* @luc.edu
* @iit.edu

Members can invite anyone. I am happy to add any Chicago-area domains. Please let me know which ones I am missing!

The slack team features channels for bioinformatics-help, general, introductions, meetups, and random currently. We can add more channels!
