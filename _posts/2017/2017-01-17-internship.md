This summer I am fortunate to have some time that I can commit to an internship. If you are looking for a graduate student to move a bioinformatic __or__ data-science __or__ a web-application project forward I may be a great fit! [My CV](https://github.com/danielecook/cv/raw/master/cv.pdf) is available for further review, but a few highlights are:

- I have developed, maintained, and deployed scientific web applications using Google Cloud Platform - [CeNDR: The _C. elegans_ Natural Diversity Resource](http://www.elegansvariation.org). I also have experience with AWS.
- I have organized, processed, and analyzed whole-genome sequence datasets for an entire species [Cook _et al._ 2016](http://andersenlab.org/publications/Cooketal.pdf).
- Extensive experience with Unix, computing clusters, and pipeline development.
- I have developed and published packages for R, Python, and Stata and contributed to a number of open-source projects. 
- My [Github profile](http://www.github.com/danielecook) reflects near-daily commitment to software development.
- I have given talks at several conferences
- Mentorship of several computer science students.
- I love cycling and exploring cities on my bike!

If you or someone you know are looking for help on a project this summer, please contact me at <a href="mailto:danielecook@gmail.com">danielecook@gmail.com</a>.

Thank you!
Dan
