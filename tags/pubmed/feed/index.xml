      <description>You can look for interesting associations between sets of search terms on PubMed by comparing how often two terms co-occur. The code below returns the number of publications where both terms are mentioned, acting as a rough estimate for how associated they are (at least, in the scholarly world).
In the example below, I show the results from organisms x diseases/disease-associated terms which is an imperfect look at how various terms estimate of how much each disease is studied in a given organism.</description>

      <description>Google Docs allows you to import XML. By using NCBIs esearch service, you can query pubmed for a list of genes. Stick the following code in A2, and a keyword in B2:
=importXML(&amp;#34;http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;amp;term=&amp;#34; &amp;amp; B2 ,&amp;#34;(//Count)[1]&amp;#34;) What is more valuable, however, is if given a gene list â€“ you can query pubmed for each gene combined with a second keyword like a disease.
For example, suppose you are studying Cleft lip and Palate and are left with a set of genes identified from a gene expression analysis.</description>
