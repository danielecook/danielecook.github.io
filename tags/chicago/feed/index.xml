      <title>Where I Run and Bike in Chicago</title>

      <description>Original Post (2014-05-25) Using runkeeper and with the help of a tutorial at flowing data, I was able to plot all of the running and biking Iâ€™ve been doing in Chicago since moving here two years ago. The blue is running and the black is biking.
 Update: Strava (2019-06-21) I have since migrated my data to Strava - which I like a lot better than runkeeper. You can migrate your data using the Tapariik service.</description>
