      <title>A tool for writing TILs (Today I Learned)</title>

      <description>There is a great repo on GitHub of TILs. The author (jbranchaud) states:
 A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don&amp;rsquo;t really warrant a full blog post.
 I think this is a pretty cool idea, but putting together the repo with the index can take time and interrupt your workflow. I wanted to make it very quick and easy to add TILs, so I wrote TIL-Tool.</description>

      <title>Parallelize by iterating over chromosomal ranges</title>

      <description>I have added a new utility to seq-collection called iter which generates chromosomal ranges. Lists of genomic ranges can be easily plugged into utilities such as xargs or gnu-parallel to parallelize commands.
For example:
sc iter test.bam 100,000 # Iterate on bins of 100k base pairs # Outputs &amp;gt; I:0-999999 &amp;gt; I:1000000-1999999 &amp;gt; I:2000000-2999999 &amp;gt; I:3000000-3999999 &amp;gt; I:4000000-4999999 Note:BAMs use a 0-based coordinate system; VCFs are 1-basedThis list of genomic ranges can be used to process a BAM or VCF in parallel:</description>

      <title>Calculate Insert Size Metrics Faster</title>

      <description>Picard tools is a great set of utilities by the Broad Institute for performing sequence analysis. however, some of the utilities run on the slower side.
To speed things up, I created a new command: insert-size as part of seq-collection. The command runs much faster, owing in part to parallelization of insert-size calculations.
insert-size does not operate in exactly the same way as picard CollectInsertSizeMetrics, but the results are very close.</description>

      <title>Converting VCF To JSON</title>

      <description>Recently I started developing a set of utilities called seq-collection (sc) written in nim and using the fantastic hts-nim package.
The first utility I added was a tool to convert a VCF to JSON. This tool is useful for building out an API that reads genotype data directly from the VCF format. It is possible to read specific variants or intervals of VCF files when they are indexed, allowing for fast and efficient querying of genetic data without the need for a database.</description>
