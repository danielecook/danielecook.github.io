      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t believe everything you read on the internet. There is an In-N-Out just outside of LAX on Sepulveda Blvd which I had thought was walkable. I was discouraged after reading this thread which suggests the walk to In-N-Out from LAX is not possible during a layover. Turns out, on a decent layover (~2.5 hours), it is totally possible!
We gave it a go because I am a big fan of In-N-Out.</description>

      <description>This may seem obvious - but I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered a wonderful trick if you ever need to review a science topic quickly or are trying to learn something new, try searching google like this:
(topic) + Lecture filetype:pdf Youâ€™ll find that tons of professors post their lecture notes online. Also try using filetype:ppt or leave filetype off (as some professors host websites with lecture notes).</description>
