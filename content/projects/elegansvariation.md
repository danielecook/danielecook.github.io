The _C. elegans_ Natural Diversity Resource (CeNDR) is scientific web application that enables users to perform genetic studies. The web application is deployed using Google Cloud Platform and is written using Flask, a python-based web framework.

The site features a genome-browser, a catalog for ordering scientific specimens, a download portal, and can also launch analytical pipelines for performing analyses. CeNDR is actively used by the scientific community and has become a valuable tool for performing studies.

I developed this resource during graduate school.
