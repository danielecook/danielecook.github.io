I've put together a simple alfred workflow with a few utilities for working with sequence data.

__[Download the latest release of Seq-Utilities][1]__

### Usage

**Generate a random dna sequence 200 base pairs long.**

**Generate the complement, reverse complement, RNA, and protein of a DNA sequence**

**Open up blast and pre-populate the search field**

```text

```
