### Original Post (2014-05-25)

<img style="float:left; margin-right:20px;border: 1px solid black;" src="/2-all.png" alt="2-all" width="366" height="1024" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-502" />

Using [runkeeper](http://www.runkeeper.com) and with the help of a tutorial at [flowing data](http://www.flowingdata.com), I was able to plot all of the running and biking I&#8217;ve been doing in Chicago since moving here two years ago. The <span style="color:#0080ff"><strong>blue</strong></span> is running and the **black** is biking.

<div style="clear:both"></div>

### Update: Strava (2019-06-21)

I have since migrated my data to Strava - which I like a lot better than runkeeper. You can migrate your data using the [Tapariik](https://tapiriik.com/) service.

Strava has a really cool global heatmap - or you can visualize your own with their pro subscription.
