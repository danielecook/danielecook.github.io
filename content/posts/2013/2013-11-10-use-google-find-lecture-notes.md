This may seem obvious - but I've discovered a wonderful trick if you ever need to review a science topic quickly or are trying to learn something new, try searching google like this:

```bash
(topic) + Lecture filetype:pdf
```



You&#8217;ll find that tons of professors post their lecture notes online. Also try using **filetype:ppt** or leave filetype off (as some professors host websites with lecture notes).
