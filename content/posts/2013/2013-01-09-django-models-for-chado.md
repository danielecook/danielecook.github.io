## Original Post (2013-01-09)

Here is my first stab at models for django of the [Chado](http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado_-_Getting_Started) database schema

[Gist â†’ Chado models](https://gist.github.com/danielecook/4494488)

## Update: machado (2019-06-20)

I originally put together a set of models for Chado in January of 2013. I later moved on from this work when I started graduate school - but a group incorporated a little bit of this work in the development of their framework for storing, searching and visualizing biological data called [machado](https://github.com/lmb-embrapa/machado).
